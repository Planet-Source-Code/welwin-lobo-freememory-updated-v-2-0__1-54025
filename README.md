## Freememory \(Updated\) v 2\.0


</div>

### Description

Very fast, faster than most memory optimizers on this site .This code free's memory, adds itself to the sysytem tray and constantly monitors memory and if it dips too low then it optimizes itself and free's memory. i've tried my best to make this as fast as possible but any tips are welcome.(Fixed the "nid" problem some users were having while using the previous version of this program)
